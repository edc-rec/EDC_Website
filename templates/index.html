          The Entrepreneurship development cell of REC is committed to creating a high-impact entrepreneurial ecosystem
          and expanding it to society through initiatives like interactive sessions, competitions, conferences, and business
          incubation services. With close to 25 years of existence, the E-Cell at the College takes pride in having equipped
          entrepreneurs and their ventures. In the process, EDC had crossed many milestones by creating many first-generation
          entrepreneurs backing them up during their incubating days.
